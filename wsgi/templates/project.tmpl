   <h1 class="center sep2">Project {{ project_id }}</h1>

   <p>This is the project's main page. You can upload the various files (html, latin1, utf-8 and from the round here). This page is not permanent. The project will be deleted 14 days after the last upload.</p>

   <p>You can bookmark the URL in your browser or this <a href="">semi permanent URL to this project</a></p>

   <h2 class="sep2">Files</h2>

   <p>Upload a file â€” Only files with the following extension will
	 be accepted: {{ allowed_ext }}. The file can be a version of the
	 document in HTML, text (either latin1 or UTF-8) and from the DP
	 rounds. If a new file has the same name as a previously uploaded
	 file, it will replace it.
   </p>

   <form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" class="i4 sep2">
	 <div>
       <input type="file" name="file" />
       <input type="submit" value="Upload" />

   <h2 class="sep2">Diffs</h2>

   <p>Once 2 or more files have been uploaded, a list of combinations
   will appear. Select one. Fix the potential issues, come back and
   upload the updated versions.

		 <p>Once files have been uploaded, they can be run through a
		   set of checks. A lot of the output is informational but can
		   still help catch errors. This is similar to existing tools
		   such as pphtml and pptxt.</p>

	   <td>
		 <h2 class="sep2">Find languages</h2>
		 <p>For html files, look for language tags, and display the
		 content in different order. In documents with many languages,
		 this helps validating that the proper language is set, that
		 the same string doesn't appear with different tags
		 (eg. <i>i</i> and <i>cite</i>) or different language tag.
		 </p>

		 {% for file in files_html %}
		   <ul class="listnone">
